<h1>Henrique Bot</h1>

This project was my first one in Python, so it was very simple and small, but I do expect to make some changes to it in the future as my python skills have been growing. For now, this bot answers to simple commands which are:
!luiz and !henrique

The first one generates a sentence that includes a formatted string with the user's username and a random champion name (from the game League of Legends).
The second one generates a random string from an array of strings with common phrases from Henrique.
